The COVID-19 pandemic has devasted countries around the world for over a year. Within the United States alone, there have been varying case numbers across states. Looking into demographic and other identifying data, the research investigates what may be the cause of the case number disparity across the country. The top five states with the highest and the lowest case numbers were considered and their demographic data was analyzed against their rates of infection. Contrary to some of the original hypotheses, demographic data was not nearly as important as anticipated. Instead, political affiliation percentages and level of education of individuals over twenty-five were the strongest indicators. The takeaway is that although states may vary greatly in terms of the social-economic and demographic breakdowns, those were not indicative of how the pandemic effected the state.
